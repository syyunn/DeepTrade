"Use of Lead Free Pipes, Fittings, Fixtures, Solder, and Flux for Drinking Water",Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing changes to existing regulations to protect the public from lead in plumbing materials used in public water systems or residential or nonresidential facilities providing water for human consumption. The changes in this rule codify aspects of the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act of 2011 (RLDWA) and the Community Fire Safety Act of 2013 (CFSA). The RLDWA amended section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), which prohibits the use and introduction into commerce of certain plumbing products that are not ``lead free.'' The RLDWA revised the definition of lead free to lower the allowable maximum lead content of plumbing products; and established a statutory method for calculating lead content. EPA is also establishing new requirements for manufacturers or importers that introduce into commerce products that must meet lead free requirements to certify such products as being in compliance with the lead free requirements in Section 1417 of the SDWA, as well as other changes to existing regulations to assist in implementation of Section 1417 of the SDWA, as amended. EPA expects that these requirements for lead content in plumbing materials used in new installations and repairs will result in fewer sources of lead in drinking water and, consequently, will reduce adverse health effects associated with exposure to lead in drinking water. The SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section details EPA's changes to existing regulations as authorized under the SDWA as amended.", 2020-16869,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/01/2020-16869/use-of-lead-free-pipes-fittings-fixtures-solder-and-flux-for-drinking-water,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-09-01/pdf/2020-16869.pdf,09/01/2020

Temporary Changes to Requirements Affecting H-2A Nonimmigrants Due To the COVID-19 National Emergency: Partial Extension of Certain Flexibilities,Rule,Homeland Security Department,"As a result of continued disruptions and uncertainty to the U.S. food agriculture sector during the summer and upcoming fall agricultural season caused by the global novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency, the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, has decided it is necessary to temporarily extend the amendments to certain regulations regarding temporary and seasonal agricultural workers, and their U.S. employers, within the H-2A nonimmigrant classification. Through this temporary final rule DHS is partially extending some of the provisions of the April 20, 2020, temporary final rule. Namely, the Department will continue to allow H- 2A employees whose extension of stay H-2A petitions are supported by valid temporary labor certifications issued by the Department of Labor to begin work with a new employer immediately after the extension of stay petition is received by USCIS. DHS will apply this temporary final rule to H-2A petitions requesting an extension of stay, if they were received on or after August 19, 2020, but no later than December 17, 2020. The temporary extension of these flexibilities will ensure that agricultural employers have access to the orderly and timely flow of legal foreign workers, thereby protecting the integrity of the nation's food supply chain and decreasing possible reliance on unauthorized aliens, while at the same time encouraging agricultural employers' use of the H-2A program, which protects the rights of U.S. and foreign workers.", 2020-18283,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/08/20/2020-18283/temporary-changes-to-requirements-affecting-h-2a-nonimmigrants-due-to-the-covid-19-national,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-08-20/pdf/2020-18283.pdf,08/20/2020

Specifically, this rule amends Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCNs) 1C350, 1C351 and 2B352 on the Commerce Control List (CCL) to reflect these AG changes. ECCN 1C350 is amended by adding twenty-four precursor chemicals, as well as mixtures in which at least one of these chemicals constitutes 30 percent or more of the weight of the mixture, to ECCN 1C350.d. ECCN 1C351 is amended to add Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-related coronavirus). ECCN 2B352 is amended by adding a Technical Note to indicate that cultivation chamber holding devices controlled in 2B352.b.2.b include single-use cultivation chambers with rigid walls. The items addressed by this final rule were not previously listed on the CCL or controlled multilaterally. BIS, consistent with the interagency process described in the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (ECRA), identified the precursor chemicals and single-use cultivation chambers addressed by this final rule as emerging technologies that are essential to U.S. national security and for which effective controls can be implemented. The inclusion of such items in this final rule is consistent with the requirements of ECRA and the decision of the AG to add such items to its common control lists, thereby making exports of such items subject to multilateral control (following the implementation of these changes by individual AG participating countries, including the United States).", 2020-11625,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/17/2020-11625/implementation-of-the-february-2020-australia-group-intersessional-decisions-addition-of-certain,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-06-17/pdf/2020-11625.pdf,06/17/2020

Temporary Changes to Requirements Affecting H-2A Nonimmigrants Due to the COVID-19 National Emergency,Rule,Homeland Security Department,"As a result of disruptions and uncertainty to the U.S. food agriculture sector during the upcoming summer agricultural season caused by the global novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency, the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, has decided to temporarily amend the regulations regarding temporary and seasonal agricultural workers, and their U.S. employers, within the H-2A nonimmigrant classification. The Department is temporarily removing certain limitations on agricultural employers and workers in order to provide agricultural employers with an orderly and timely flow of legal foreign workers, thereby protecting the integrity of the nation's food supply chain and decreasing possible reliance on unauthorized aliens, while encouraging agricultural employers' use of the H-2A program, which protects the rights of U.S. and foreign workers. Namely, the Department will allow H-2A employers whose extension of stay H-2A petitions are supported by valid temporary labor certifications (TLCs) issued by the Department of Labor to begin work immediately after the extension of stay petition is received by USCIS. The Department is also temporarily amending its regulations to allow H-2A workers to stay in the United States beyond the 3 years maximum allowable period of stay. DHS will apply this temporary final rule to H-2A petitions requesting an extension of stay, and, if applicable, any associated applications for an extension of stay filed by or on behalf of an H-2A worker, if they were received on or after March 1, 2020 and remain pending as of the effective date of this rule, as well as H-2A petitions for an extension of stay, received on or after the effective date of this rule, ending on the last day this rule is in effect.", 2020-08356,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/04/20/2020-08356/temporary-changes-to-requirements-affecting-h-2a-nonimmigrants-due-to-the-covid-19-national,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-04-20/pdf/2020-08356.pdf,04/20/2020

Modification of Regulations Regarding the Steel Import Monitoring and Analysis System,Proposed Rule,Commerce Department; International Trade Administration,"On May 17, 2019, the United States announced joint understandings with Canada and Mexico, respectively, to eliminate tariffs imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, on imports of steel and aluminum products from Canada and Mexico and to establish a process for monitoring such imports. Consistent with the joint understandings, and to enhance U.S. Government monitoring and analysis of steel imports more generally, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) publishes this proposed rule to enhance its existing Steel Import Monitoring and Analysis (SIMA) system to allow for the effective and timely monitoring of import surges of specific steel products which will aid in the prevention of transshipment of steel products. Specifically, Commerce proposes to modify its regulations to require import license applicants to identify the country where the steel used in the manufacture of the imported steel product was melted and poured, and to release this data on an aggregate basis, as appropriate; to harmonize the scope of SIMA's licensing requirement with the scope of steel products subject to Section 232 tariffs; to extend the SIMA system indefinitely by eliminating the regulatory provision concerning the duration of the SIMA system; and to expand eligibility for use of the low-value license for certain steel entries.

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Compressed Natural Gas Fuel Container Integrity,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,"In response to petitions for rulemaking from the American Trucking Associations (ATA) and the Natural Gas Vehicles for America (NGVAmerica), NHTSA is proposing to amend the visual inspection labeling requirement in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 304, ``Compressed natural gas fuel container integrity,'' to state that CNG fuel containers used on heavy vehicles should be inspected at least once every 12 months. NHTSA is proposing this change because CNG heavy vehicles are typically used in high-mileage commercial fleet operations and following the current mileage-based inspection interval on the label means conducting multiple visual inspections per year. NHTSA has tentatively concluded multiple visual inspections per year based solely on mileage would not improve vehicle safety for these high-mileage CNG heavy vehicles, and could potentially reduce safety. Because the current periodic visual inspection interval is intended for light vehicles and is consistent with the operation of these vehicles, no change is proposed to the periodic visual inspection interval for CNG fuel containers on light vehicles.", 2019-12895,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/06/21/2019-12895/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards-compressed-natural-gas-fuel-container-integrity,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-06-21/pdf/2019-12895.pdf,06/21/2019

Labor Certification Process for Temporary Employment in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CW-1 Workers),Rule,Labor Department; Employment and Training Administration,"The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) is issuing new regulations governing the certification of temporary employment opportunities to be filled by nonimmigrant workers in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and the obligations applicable to employers of such workers under the CNMI-Only Transitional Worker visa program (CW-1). This interim final rule (IFR), implementing provisions of the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act of 2018 (Workforce Act), establishes the process by which a CNMI employer will obtain a prevailing wage determination (PWD) and temporary labor certification (TLC) from DOL for use in petitioning the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to employ a nonimmigrant worker in CW-1 status. Although the CW-1 visa classification predates the Workforce Act, classification as a CW-1 nonimmigrant does not currently require a labor certification. The Workforce Act institutes a labor certification requirement as a prerequisite for approval of a CW-1 petition by DHS and charges the Department with promulgating an IFR to administer this new labor certification requirement.

Management Standards for Hazardous Waste Pharmaceuticals and Amendment to the P075 Listing for Nicotine,Rule,Environmental Protection Agency,"Some pharmaceuticals are regulated as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) when discarded. This final rule adds regulations for the management of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals by healthcare facilities and reverse distributors. Healthcare facilities (for both humans and animals) and reverse distributors will manage their hazardous waste pharmaceuticals under this new set of sector-specific standards in lieu of the existing hazardous waste generator regulations. Among other things, these new regulations prohibit the disposal of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals down the drain and eliminates the dual regulation of RCRA hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are also Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) controlled substances. The new rules also maintain the household hazardous waste exemption for pharmaceuticals collected during pharmaceutical take-back programs and events, while ensuring their proper disposal. The new rules codify Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s prior policy on the regulatory status of nonprescription pharmaceuticals going through reverse logistics. Additionally, EPA is excluding certain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) from regulation as hazardous waste and is establishing a policy on the regulatory status of unsold retail items that are not pharmaceuticals and are managed via reverse logistics, fulfilling the commitment we made in the Retail Strategy of September 2016.", 2019-01298,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/02/22/2019-01298/management-standards-for-hazardous-waste-pharmaceuticals-and-amendment-to-the-p075-listing-for,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-02-22/pdf/2019-01298.pdf,02/22/2019

Operation of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Over People,Proposed Rule,Transportation Department; Federal Aviation Administration,"The FAA proposes to amend its rules applicable to the operation of small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). This rulemaking would allow operations of small unmanned aircraft over people in certain conditions and operations of small UAS at night without obtaining a waiver.

Bump-Stock-Type Devices,Rule,"Justice Department; Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives Bureau","The Department of Justice is amending the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to clarify that bump-stock-type devices--meaning ``bump fire'' stocks, slide-fire devices, and devices with certain similar characteristics--are ``machineguns'' as defined by the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968 because such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger. Specifically, these devices convert an otherwise semiautomatic firearm into a machinegun by functioning as a self-acting or self-regulating mechanism that harnesses the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter. Hence, a semiautomatic firearm to which a bump-stock-type device is attached is able to produce automatic fire with a single pull of the trigger. With limited exceptions, the Gun Control Act, as amended, makes it unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun unless it was lawfully possessed prior to the effective date of the statute. The bump-stock-type devices covered by this final rule were not in existence prior to the effective date of the statute, and therefore will be prohibited when this rule becomes effective. Consequently, under the final rule, current possessors of these devices will be required to destroy the devices or abandon them at an ATF office prior to the effective date of the rule.", 2018-27763,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/12/26/2018-27763/bump-stock-type-devices,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-12-26/pdf/2018-27763.pdf,12/26/2018

The Standard for Determining Joint-Employer Status,Proposed Rule,National Labor Relations Board,"In order to more effectively enforce the National Labor Relations Act (the Act or the NLRA) and to further the purposes of the Act, the National Labor Relations Board (the Board) proposes a regulation establishing the standard for determining whether two employers, as defined in Section 2(2) of the Act, are a joint employer of a group of employees under the NLRA. The Board believes that this rulemaking will foster predictability and consistency regarding determinations of joint-employer status in a variety of business relationships, thereby promoting labor-management stability, one of the principal purposes of the Act. Under the proposed regulation, an employer may be considered a joint employer of a separate employer's employees only if the two employers share or codetermine the employees' essential terms and conditions of employment, such as hiring, firing, discipline, supervision, and direction. More specifically, to be deemed a joint employer under the proposed regulation, an employer must possess and actually exercise substantial direct and immediate control over the essential terms and conditions of employment of another employer's employees in a manner that is not limited and routine.", 2018-19930,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/14/2018-19930/the-standard-for-determining-joint-employer-status,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-09-14/pdf/2018-19930.pdf,09/14/2018
Submissions of Exclusion Requests and Objections to Submitted Requests for Steel and Aluminum,Rule,Commerce Department; Industry and Security Bureau,"On March 8, 2018, President Trump issued Proclamations 9704 and 9705 (referred to henceforth as the ``Proclamations''), imposing duties on imports of aluminum and steel. The Proclamations also authorized the Secretary of Commerce (referred to henceforth as the ``Secretary'') to grant exclusions from the duties if the Secretary determines the steel or aluminum article for which the exclusion is requested is not ``produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount or of a satisfactory quality'' or should be excluded ``based upon specific national security considerations.'' On March 19, 2018, the Department issued an interim final rule (referred to henceforth as the ``March 19 rule''), setting forth the requirements a directly affected party located in the United States must satisfy when submitting exclusion requests. The March 19 rule also set forth the requirements that U.S. parties must meet when submitting objections to exclusion requests. The March 19 rule amended the National Security Industrial Base Regulations to add two new supplements. The rule published today by BIS, on behalf of the Secretary, revises the two supplements added by the March 19 rule. The revisions are informed by the comments received in response to the March 19 rule and the U.S. Department of Commerce's (referred to henceforth as ``the Department'') experience with managing the exclusion and objection process. The Department understands the importance of having a transparent, fair and efficient exclusion and objection process. The publication of today's rule should make significant improvements in all three respects, but due to the scope of this new process, BIS is publishing today's rule as an interim final rule with request for comments.", 2018-19662,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/09/11/2018-19662/submissions-of-exclusion-requests-and-objections-to-submitted-requests-for-steel-and-aluminum,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2018-09-11/pdf/2018-19662.pdf,09/11/2018
